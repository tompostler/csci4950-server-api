# Information

This documentation is being considerably condensed because you are expected to understand how a
RESTful Web API works. If you don't, see
[this link](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html) which describes it for you. The
basics are explained in the next section, [Requests](#requests).

The current server hosting the API is `https://msfrizzle.me/api`, and the current server version
(along with other useful information) can be found at the `info` node
(https://msfrizzle.me/api/info).




## Requests

There are five types of requests you can make against the server, each of which performs a different
action detailed below:

* `GET`
* `PUT`
* `POST`
* `DELETE`
* `OPTIONS`

Requests will always have a status code representing what happend, potentially with a response body.

To send data with a request, the HTTP header `Content-Type` must be `application/json` if you are
sending JSON in the request body. You will most likely receive an error otherwise.

When requesting an entire collection, the current user's ID is automatically applied based on the
authorization token.

| HTTP Verb | Entire Collection (e.g. /users)   | Specific Item (e.g. /users/{id}) |
| :---      | :---                              | :--- |
| GET       | `200 OK`, list of items           | `200 OK`, single item. `404 Not Found`, if ID not found |
| PUT       | `405 Method Not Allowed`          | `204 No Content`. `404 Not Found`, if ID not found |
| POST      | `200 OK`, containing the new item | `200 OK`, containing the new item |
| DELETE    | `405 Method Not Allowed`          | `204 No Content`. `404 Not Found`, if ID not found |

__Notes:__
    
- If there is no valid match to the query or action, then a status of `404 Not Found` is returned to
the caller, regardless of what it says are possible return results.
- If some action causes an error, then a generic status of `400 Bad Request` is returned to the
caller, regardless of what it says are possible return results.
- If there is an issue with the Authorization header and the request placed, then the `400 Bad
Request` status is returned with an error message saying what went wrong.

### auth Node

REFACTOR

The auth node only supports `POST` requests.

There are two interfaces to an auth instance: one for the request and one for the response.

The request interface, sent by the client to the server with the `POST` request:

Parameter | Description
:--- | :---
`user_id` | An integer correlating to an existing user ID. This will link an auth instance to a specific user.
`password` | The password of the user.

The response interface, sent by the server to the client when responding to a `POST` request:

Parameter | Description
:--- | :---
`user_id` | An integer correlating to an existing user ID. This will link an auth instance to a specific user.
`token` | A 64-character base64-encoded string corresponding to a user-specific auth instance. For details on how this works, see [API Security](#api-security).
`etime` | A date and time in [UTC format](#date-time-formats) corresponding to the expiration of the token. A token expires in 24 hours from its creation.



### courses Node

This contains a list of all courses offered by the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, gathered
on March 25, 2015.

The courses node only supports `GET` requests.

`name` | A 100-character string corresponding to the course name (e.g. "Senior Software Project").


#### GET

Querying by `name` is not supported. Querying by `id` returns all courses whose `id` contains the
parameter you used for the query.

`password` will be `null`.




## Subnodes

For any request type (not including `GET` requests), an ID can be used to work with one item of the
corresponding type from a root node.

For `PUT` and `DELETE` requests, this format is necessary to work with only one item at a time.

# Notes

Random notes and things that don't have a better place in this documentation.



### API Security

This API features three main security features.

The first is HTTPS. All types of requests on all controllers that handle user-specific data require
HTTPS for any action.

The second security feature is token-based authentication. All `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE`
requests relating to a specific user require that a server-generated token (described further
[below](#token-generation)) be supplied in the `Authorization` HTTP header of the request. Greyson
should have completely encapsulated token handling and the details will not need to be explained
further.

The last security feature is that the request can only request, modify, add, or delete data
corresponding to the user that a token was generated for. This will prevent one user from modifying
another user's password (for example).



### Password Storage

Passwords will only be accepted by the API in POST requests over an HTTPS connection.

Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and stored in the database. You cannot retrieve a password for a
specific user.



### Token Generation

A user must be created.

Then a request is sent to the `auth` node with the user id and password.
    
Handed back is the base64-encoded token and the expiration time in UTC format.

For more information, have a good reason to need the information, and then talk to Tom.



### Date/Time Formats

Any Date/Time formats that are passed in or received via the URL or in JSON bodies will be
represented by the standard UTC format of `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ`.
    
For example, February 18th, 2014 at 9:25:07 PM CST would translate to `2015-02-19T03:25:07Z` (with
Daylight Savings Time not in effect on that date, CST is 6 hours behind UTC).
